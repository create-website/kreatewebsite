    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a vertical, single-page timeline to guide users through the chronological narrative of Ramlila's final 10 days. This structure is the most intuitive for storytelling, allowing users to scroll through the events in order. A sticky side navigation bar is included for non-linear exploration, enabling users to jump directly to any specific day. This dual-navigation approach supports both guided discovery and specific information retrieval, making the complex story easy to follow and reference. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The primary presentation method is structured textual content, organized into thematic cards for each day to enhance readability. Report Info: Events of each day -> Goal: Inform -> Presentation: Themed text sections with clear headings -> Interaction: Scrolling and direct navigation via side-menu. For the final day, a symbolic visualization is used. Report Info: Victory of Good over Evil -> Goal: Symbolize Climax -> Viz: Donut Chart -> Interaction: Hover for tooltip -> Justification: A simple, impactful visual to conclude the narrative, representing the triumph of Dharma. -> Library: Chart.js. This confirms NO SVG/Mermaid is used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

A legendary, final battle ensues between Rama and the ten-headed demon king. Rama, using the divine Brahmastra weapon given to him by the sage Agastya, pierces Ravana's heart, his only vulnerable point, and vanquishes him. The war ends, and Dharma (righteousness) is restored.",
