    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Earth Tones -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a thematic, scroll-based narrative with five key sections: The Alliance, The Feast, The Myth, The Mourning, and a Conclusion. This non-linear, thematic approach was chosen over a simple chronological report to better highlight the central theme of conflicting perspectives and the evolution of the holiday's meaning. A sticky navigation allows users to jump between themes, while interactive elements within each section (side-by-side comparisons, clickable timelines, interactive charts) encourage exploration and active learning rather than passive reading. The user flow is designed to first establish the historical context, then deconstruct the popular myths, and finally present the critical Indigenous counter-narrative, leading to a more nuanced understanding. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Wampanoag Population Data -> Goal: Inform/Impact -> Viz: Large, bold statistic card -> Interaction: None -> Justification: The stark number "90%" is more powerful than a complex chart for conveying the scale of the catastrophe. -> Method: HTML/Tailwind.
        - 1621 vs. Modern Menu -> Goal: Compare/Engage -> Viz: Interactive card component with a supporting Donut Chart -> Interaction: User clicks on food category buttons to update the text comparison dynamically. -> Justification: An interactive comparison is more engaging than a static table and encourages direct user involvement. The donut chart provides a quick visual summary of the culinary shift. -> Library: Chart.js.
        - Holiday Creation Timeline -> Goal: Show Change/Organize -> Viz: Vertical timeline -> Interaction: Clicking on a date reveals detailed information in an adjacent panel. -> Justification: A timeline is the most intuitive way to show the process of the holiday's formal establishment over many decades. -> Method: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Indigenous Perspective/Speech -> Goal: Inform/Impact -> Viz: A visually distinct, block-quoted section with a somber color scheme. -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Presenting the speech text with solemnity and focus, free of distractions, honors its importance and emotional weight. -> Method: HTML/Tailwind.

The Pilgrims had hardly explored the shores of Cape Cod four days before they had robbed the graves of my ancestors, and stolen their corn, wheat, and beans... Our spirit refuses to die. Yesterday we walked the woodland paths and sandy trails. Today we must walk the macadam highways and roads. We are uniting. We're standing not in our wigwams but in your concrete tent. We stand tall and proud and before us is the dawn of a new day. We shall not be silenced."</p>

                <p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-[#6F5B51]">Understanding Thanksgiving requires holding its conflicting narratives in tension. It is a story of survival and of conquest, of national unity and of profound injustice. It can be a day for gratitude, while also being a moment for sober reflection on the full, complex, and often painful history of a nation.</p>
