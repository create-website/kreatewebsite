    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a top-down narrative journey. It begins with a broad introduction (Hero), delves into the core spiritual practice (The Nine Nights), explores the foundational stories (Mythology), showcases cultural diversity (Regional Traditions), details common practices (Rituals), and concludes with the festival's culmination (Final Victory). This thematic structure, rather than mirroring the report's linear format, allows users to engage with the most compelling content first—the interactive Navadurga section—and then explore related concepts in a logical flow. The interactive map and clickable goddess cards are chosen to transform passive reading into active discovery, making the dense information more accessible and memorable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Navadurga Grid: Report Info -> 9 forms of Durga. Goal -> Organize & Inform. Viz -> Interactive card grid. Interaction -> Click to reveal details. Justification -> Breaks down a large block of information into a user-driven, digestible format. Method -> JS DOM manipulation.
        - Regional Map: Report Info -> Geographic celebrations. Goal -> Compare & Organize. Viz -> Stylized HTML/CSS map. Interaction -> Click region to show info panel. Justification -> Provides immediate geographic context and simplifies comparison. Method -> JS show/hide logic.
        - Thematic Chart: Report Info -> Thematic division of nights (Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati). Goal -> Inform. Viz -> Donut Chart. Interaction -> Hover tooltips. Justification -> Visually represents the spiritual progression of the festival. Library -> Chart.js on Canvas.
        - All textual content is dynamically rendered from JS objects to keep the HTML clean and support the interactive structure.

                    <p class="text-[#6D4C41]">The primary legend recounts the creation of Goddess Durga, a consolidation of all divine powers, to defeat the buffalo-demon Mahishasura. After a fierce nine-night battle, she emerges victorious on the tenth day, restoring peace to the cosmos. This story establishes Shakti as the ultimate protective force, hailed as *Mahishasuramardini*, the Slayer of Mahishasura.</p>

This "untimely awakening" (*Akalbodhan*) of the Goddess ensures his victory and underscores the idea that even divine avatars seek the power of Shakti to overcome evil. The festival culminates in the burning of Ravana's effigy, symbolizing the destruction of evil.</p>
