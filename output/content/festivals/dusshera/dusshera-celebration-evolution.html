                    <p class="text-gray-600">The earliest forms of Dussehra celebrations were grand spectacles patronized by kings and emperors. It was a time to display military strength and seek divine blessings for victory and prosperity.</p>

                        <li><strong>Vijayanagara Empire:</strong> Historical accounts describe elaborate 'Mahanavami Dibba' celebrations, where the king would review his army, and the festivities included grand processions, worship of weapons (Ayudha Puja), and athletic contests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mysore Dasara:</strong> The Wadiyar dynasty of Mysore established a tradition of opulent Dasara festivities in the 17th century. The grand procession (Jamboo Savari) with the king seated on a decorated elephant became a hallmark of royal authority and devotion to Goddess Chamundeshwari.</li>
                        <li><strong>Kullu Dussehra:</strong> Started in the 17th century by Raja Jagat Singh, this unique celebration involves the congregation of hundreds of local deities to pay homage to Lord Raghunath, showcasing a blend of royal and folk traditions.</li>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Colonial Era & Community Shift</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">During British rule, the nature of Dussehra celebrations began to change. With the decline of royal patronage in many regions, the festival transitioned from a state-sponsored event to a community-driven one.</p>

                        <li><strong>Rise of Public Celebrations:</strong> Communities began organizing their own festivities through subscriptions ('chanda'). This led to the emergence of 'Sarvajanik' (public) Durga Pujas in Bengal, which also served as a space for fostering nationalist sentiments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ramlila Performances:</strong> The tradition of Ramlila, the dramatic enactment of the Ramayana, gained immense popularity. It became a powerful tool for cultural preservation and community bonding, independent of state control.</li>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">After 1947, Dussehra evolved into a symbol of national culture. Modernization and technology have transformed it into a large-scale public spectacle, blending tradition with contemporary elements.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>The Effigy Phenomenon:</strong> The burning of Ravana effigies became a massive public event, especially in North India. Over the years, these effigies have grown in size and are often filled with spectacular fireworks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Commercialization:</strong> The festival has seen significant commercialization, with large sponsorships, elaborate themed pandals, and bustling melas (fairs) offering food, rides, and shopping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Globalization:</strong> Dussehra is now celebrated by the Indian diaspora across the world, from New Jersey to London, adapting to new environments while keeping traditions alive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eco-Consciousness:</strong> In recent years, there is a growing awareness about the environmental impact, leading to a push for eco-friendly idols, cracker-free effigies, and sustainable celebration practices.</li>
