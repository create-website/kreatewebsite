From savory snacks to delectable sweets, let's explore the gastronomic journey of Dussehra.</p>

                    <li><strong>Jalebi & Fafda:</strong> A classic sweet and savory breakfast. Fafda are crisp, fried strips of gram flour, perfectly complemented by sweet, syrupy jalebis.
                        <br><strong>Why:</strong> This treat is a celebratory indulgence after the Navaratri fast. It's believed that Lord Rama loved a sweet called 'Shashkuli' (similar to jalebi).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Puran Poli (Maharashtra):</strong> A sweet flatbread stuffed with a delicious mixture of cooked lentils (chana dal) and jaggery, flavored with cardamom and nutmeg.
                         <br><strong>Why:</strong> It's a traditional festive dish, prepared on auspicious occasions to signify happiness and prosperity.

                    <li><strong>Rasgulla & Sandesh:</strong> No Bengali celebration is complete without these iconic sweets made from fresh chhena (cottage cheese). They are offered to guests as a symbol of sweet beginnings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Luchi and Alur Dom:</strong> Fluffy, deep-fried bread (luchi) served with a slow-cooked spicy potato curry (alur dom) is a quintessential festive meal.
                        <br><strong>Why:</strong> After the immersion of Goddess Durga's idol, families visit each other. These foods are central to the hospitality and social bonding that marks Bijoya Dashami.

                    <li><strong>Sundal:</strong> A savory and healthy dish made from boiled legumes like chickpeas, black-eyed peas, or peanuts, tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves, and grated coconut.
                        <br><strong>Why:</strong> A different type of sundal is prepared each of the nine nights as an offering (prasad). It's easy to distribute and provides protein for those fasting.
