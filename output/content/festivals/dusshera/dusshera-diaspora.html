                    <p class="text-gray-600">Celebrating Dussehra abroad comes with a unique set of challenges, leading to innovative solutions and adaptations.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 text-gray-600 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Logistical Hurdles:</strong> Getting permits for large public gatherings and effigy burning can be complex. Communities often work for months with local authorities to ensure safety and compliance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sourcing Materials:</strong> Finding traditional materials for pujas, decorations, and effigy-making can be difficult. Many items are imported, or local substitutes are creatively used.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> As Dussehra is not a public holiday, major celebrations are often shifted to the nearest weekend to allow families and working professionals to participate fully.</li>
                        <li><strong>Passing on Traditions:</strong> A key focus is involving the younger generation, born and raised abroad, through workshops, storytelling sessions, and participation in Ramlila plays to keep them connected to their roots.</li>
