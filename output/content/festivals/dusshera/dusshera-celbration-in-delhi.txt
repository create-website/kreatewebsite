One such festival celebrated with enormous zeal and enthusiasm across the country is Dussehra. Known by various names like Vijaydashami, Dasara, or Dashain, this festival commemorates the victory of good over evil.

In the heart of the nation, Delhi, the Dusshera celebrations are marked by grandeur, vigour, and an unmissable festive spirit. The entire city glows with the festivity, and the atmosphere is infused with an electrifying energy during this time. Let us tell you about the marvelous Dussehra celebrations in Delhi.

A City Dressed in Festivity

Around Dusshera, Delhi takes on a new life. The usually bustling cities turn into vibrant canvases painted with hues of festivity. Traditional motifs and symbols related to the festival adorn the streets and markets. The air is perfumed with the aroma of marigold flowers and the incense from the city temples.

The Majestic Ramlilas

The celebration of Dussehra in Delhi isn't complete without the local Ramlilas, the dramatic portrayal of the life of Lord Rama. Some of these Ramlilas have been held in the city for centuries and are extraordinarily popular among Delhites. They are large-scale productions, with elaborate sets, costumes, and a significant number of actors. The Ramlila at Ramnagar is particularly famous and draws a massive crowd every year.

The Effigy Burning: Ravan Dahan

Another significant element of Dussehra in Delhi is the effigy burning ritual, often referred to as 'Ravan Dahan'. Large effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhkaran, and son Meghnad are crafted, filled with firecrackers, and set ablaze on Dussehra, symbolizing the victory of good over evil. This spectacle is witnessed by thousands at places like Ramlila Maidan, where the effigies are often several feet tall.
