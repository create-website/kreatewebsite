Unlike mainstream celebrations, it has no connection to the Ramayana. The festivities are a vibrant amalgamation of tribal, Hindu, and royal traditions. Key rituals include:</p>

                <p class="text-gray-600">In a fascinating departure from the mainstream narrative, several communities in India worship Ravana during Dussehra. In Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, Ravana is revered as a learned scholar and the son-in-law of the city (as his wife Mandodari is believed to have hailed from there). The Gond tribe of Maharashtra also worships Ravana, considering him a symbol of wisdom and power.</p>

                <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400/EC4899/FFFFFF?text=Shami+Tree" alt="Shami Tree" class="rounded-lg mb-4">
                <p class="text-gray-600">In many parts of India, particularly in rural communities, the Shami tree holds great significance during Dussehra. It is believed that the Pandavas hid their divine weapons in a Shami tree during their exile. On Vijayadashami, people worship the tree and exchange its leaves, known as 'sona' (gold), as a symbol of good fortune and prosperity.</p>
