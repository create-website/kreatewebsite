                <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                    Dhanteras marks the beginning of the five-day Diwali festival, celebrated on the thirteenth lunar day of the Hindu month of Kartik.[1, 2] The name itself is a blend of the Sanskrit words <em>Dhan</em>, meaning wealth, and <em>Teras</em>, meaning thirteenth.[3, 2] This day is dedicated to inaugurating prosperity, but its legends and rituals reveal a sophisticated philosophy that intrinsically links material wealth with physical health and well-being.[4, 5]

                    <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                        The most foundational story is the <em>Samudra Manthan</em>, the churning of the cosmic ocean by gods and demons to obtain the elixir of immortality.[4, 5] On this day, two divine beings emerged: Goddess Lakshmi, the embodiment of wealth, and Lord Dhanvantari, the divine physician, carrying the pot of <em>Amrit</em> (the elixir).[3, 2] Their simultaneous appearance establishes a profound connection between wealth and health, suggesting true prosperity is incomplete without vitality. The day is also celebrated as Dhanvantari Jayanti, a day to pray for good health.[5, 1]

                    <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                        A popular legend tells of a prince prophesied to die from a snakebite on the fourth night of his marriage.[4, 3] To save him, his wise wife laid out all her gold and silver ornaments in a glittering heap and lit countless lamps.[4] When Yama, the god of death, arrived as a serpent, his eyes were dazzled by the brilliance. Charmed and distracted, he lingered until sunrise and had to depart, sparing the prince's life.[4, 6] This story directly links lighting lamps and displaying wealth with warding off death.[5]

                    <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                        The day begins with a thorough cleaning of homes and businesses, symbolically sweeping away negativity to create a sanctified space for positive energy.[3, 1] Doorways are then adorned with intricate <em>rangoli</em>‚Äîcolorful patterns made from powders or flowers‚Äîand tiny footprints are often drawn with rice flour to guide Goddess Lakshmi into the home.[4, 3]

                    <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                        The most visible tradition is the purchasing of new items. It is considered highly auspicious to buy precious metals like gold and silver, or at the very least, new steel utensils.[5, 3] This act is a ritual investment in future prosperity, with the belief that wealth acquired on this day will multiply throughout the year.[5, 6]

                    <p class="text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                        In the evening, families perform a <em>puja</em> (worship ceremony) to honor Lord Ganesha, Goddess Lakshmi, and sometimes Lord Kubera (the treasurer of the gods).[4, 3] A special ritual involves lighting thirteen earthen lamps (<em>diyas</em>) and placing them outside the home facing south. This is done to appease Yama, the god of death, and seek protection for the household from untimely death, directly echoing the legend of the saved prince.[4, 6]
