                    The internet today is primarily a web of documents, designed for human consumption. We are on the cusp of a paradigm shift towards an "Agentic Web"—a dynamic, decentralized network of intelligent agents that can discover, communicate, and collaborate with each other to perform complex tasks on behalf of users. This vision requires a common language and a standardized way for agents to interact. This is where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) becomes a foundational layer for this new internet.

            <!-- The "Agentic Web" Concept -->
            <section id="agentic-web" class="mb-16">
                 <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 text-center">What is the "Agentic Web"?</h2>
                 <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">As described in concepts emerging from communities like Wikipedia, the Agentic Web envisions a global network where autonomous AI agents are first-class citizens. Instead of a human navigating from webpage to webpage, agents will navigate a web of other agents and services, programmatically executing tasks. An agent could find a specialized travel agent, negotiate a booking, and coordinate with a calendar agent without direct human intervention.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">This network is inherently decentralized. Agents won't all live in one massive data center; they will be hosted by individuals, companies, and organizations across the globe, each with its own unique capabilities and data access.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 text-center">MCP: The Handshake Protocol for Agents</h2>
                <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">For the Agentic Web to function, two fundamental challenges must be solved: discoverability (how do agents find each other?) and interoperability (how do they talk once they meet?). MCP provides a robust answer to both.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Discoverability:</strong> An MCP server acts as a public-facing "storefront" for an agent or a group of agents. By exposing a standard set of endpoints, it advertises the tools and resources it offers. Other agents can query this storefront to understand its capabilities before deciding to interact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> MCP standardizes the "grammar" of agent-to-tool communication. By defining a common format for tool calls, resource fetching, and context management, it ensures that an agent built in Python by one organization can seamlessly use a tool hosted by an agent built in .NET by another, without any custom integration code.</li>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8 text-center">Future Vision: A Federated Agent Ecosystem</h2>
                <div class="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 p-8 rounded-lg">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-900 mb-3">Protocol Registries and Federated Servers</h3>
                    <p class="text-indigo-800 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        As the Agentic Web matures, we can expect higher-level coordination structures to emerge, built on top of the MCP foundation.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-3 text-lg text-indigo-800">
                         <li><strong>Protocol Registries:</strong> Think of these as the "DNS for agents." A global, decentralized registry could allow agents to look up other agents by name, capability, or reputation score. An agent could query the registry for "all certified financial analysis agents" and receive a list of MCP server endpoints to contact.</li>
                         <li><strong>Federated MCP Servers:</strong> Rather than one giant server, a federation of trusted MCP servers could share information and route requests intelligently. An agent's request to its local server could be seamlessly forwarded to another server in the federation that has the required tool, enabling a vast, collaborative network that is both scalable and resilient.</li>

                 <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                   The Agentic Web represents a fundamental reimagining of the internet—from a passive repository of information to an active ecosystem of intelligent actors. Protocols like MCP are the essential building blocks, providing the structure, standards, and trust needed to turn this ambitious vision into a reality.
