                    Most enterprises don't have the luxury of starting from a blank slate. They have years, or even decades, of investment in existing APIs, internal functions, and microservices that are critical to business operations. The promise of agentic AI can seem distant when faced with this complex landscape. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a powerful and pragmatic path forward, allowing you to wrap these legacy systems and expose them to modern AI agents in a standardized, secure way.

                 <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">The core idea is not to replace your existing systems, but to build a thin "adapter" or "wrapper" layer around them. This wrapper translates the standardized language of MCP into the specific protocol and data format that your legacy service understands.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">An MCP tool definition acts as this adapter. It describes what the tool does in natural language for the agent, specifies the inputs it needs, and contains the logic to call the underlying legacy API, function, or microservice. The agent only ever interacts with the clean MCP interface, remaining completely unaware of the complexity behind the scenes.</p>

                <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">A gradual migration is almost always preferable to a "big bang" approach. These patterns help ensure a smooth transition while maintaining business continuity.</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
                        <li><strong>Strangler Fig Pattern:</strong> Gradually "strangle" the old system by routing more and more traffic to the new MCP-wrapped endpoints. Start with one small piece of functionality, wrap it in an MCP tool, and direct new agentic workflows to use it. Over time, you add more wrappers until the old, direct integrations are no longer used.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parallel Run:</strong> For a period, run both the old system and the new MCP-wrapped system side-by-side. This allows you to compare outputs and validate that the new MCP integration behaves as expected before fully cutting over. This is ideal for critical, high-risk systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backward Compatibility:</strong> The MCP server itself can be designed to support multiple versions of a tool. This allows older agents or applications to continue using a stable version while new agents can take advantage of updated functionality, ensuring no one is left behind during the migration.</li>

                        Migrating legacy integrations to a unified MCP interface is more than just a technical exercise; it delivers tangible business value.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-3 text-lg text-indigo-800">
                         <li><strong>Reduced Maintenance Overhead:</strong> Instead of maintaining dozens of bespoke, point-to-point integrations, you maintain a single, standardized protocol. This dramatically simplifies debugging, updates, and security monitoring.</li>
                         <li><strong>Unified, Discoverable Interface:</strong> MCP provides a single "front door" for all your enterprise tools. New developers and AI agents can easily discover and understand how to use available capabilities, accelerating development and innovation.</li>
                         <li><strong>Future-Proofing Your Architecture:</strong> By decoupling your AI agents from your backend systems, you gain immense flexibility. You can swap out a legacy microservice for a modern one without your agents even noticing, as long as the MCP tool interface remains consistent.</li>
                    </ul>
