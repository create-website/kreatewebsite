                    The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has laid a crucial foundation for building robust, interoperable multi-agent systems. However, we are still in the early days. The frontier of agentic AI is constantly expanding, presenting new challenges and exciting research directions. This is a look at the open questions, emerging ideas, and pioneering academic work that are shaping the future of MCP and intelligent agent ecosystems.

                        <p class="text-gray-700">MCP standardizes the *syntax* of communication, but not the *meaning*. How do we ensure two agents from different domains have a shared understanding of what a "customer" or "product" is?</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700">For MCP to become the "HTTP of agents," it needs a formal, community-driven standardization process to ensure stability, security, and broad adoption across industries and platforms.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">The future likely isn't purely centralized or decentralized. A hybrid model could offer the best of both worlds: a decentralized network of agents for resilience and autonomy, combined with trusted, centralized "registry" servers for efficient discovery, reputation management, and governance. This balances flexibility with control.</p>

                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">What if agents could negotiate how they communicate in real-time? An emerging idea is for agents to start with a basic handshake protocol and then dynamically negotiate up to a more advanced version of MCP or even switch to a different, domain-specific protocol if both support it. This would allow the agentic web to evolve organically without breaking backward compatibility.</p>

                         <li><strong>Anemoi: The "Operating System" for LLMs:</strong> This project explores a system-level approach to managing tools and resources for agents, closely mirroring the architectural goals of MCP. It highlights the need for a robust, OS-like layer to handle context, security, and resource allocation efficiently.</li>
                         <li><strong>A2A + MCP Integration:</strong> Research into formally combining Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols with MCP is critical. While MCP excels at the agent-to-tool interface, A2A focuses on peer-to-peer agent messaging. A formal bridge would allow agents to not only use tools but also coordinate complex strategies and negotiations with each other in a standardized way.</li>
